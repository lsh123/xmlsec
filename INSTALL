Compilation

1. How to compile XMLSec?

As most UNIX libraries XMLSec follows the "standard":

     gunzip -c xmlsec-xxx.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     cd xmlsec-xxxx
     ./configure --help

to see the options, then the compilation/installation proper

     ./configure [possible options]
     make
     make install

Probably you may have to rerun ldconfig or similar utility to
update your list of installed shared libs. At this point you can check 
that the library is compiled successfully by running

     make check

Alternatively there are several community maintained ports to CMake
build system:

* https://github.com/vmiklos/odfsig/tree/master/extern/xmlsec

* https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/xmlsec


2.What other libraries are needed to compile/install XMLSec? 
XMLSec requires following libraries:

    LibXML2 (http://xmlsoft.org): a very powerfull XML parsing and
	manipulating library
    LibXSLT (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/): a nice XSLT processor based
	on LibXML2
    OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org): well known cryptographic library

If you are running a Linux system then there is a good chance that
you already have all libraries installed. Also XMLSec requires the 
normal C ANSI API (please report any violation to this rule you may find).
