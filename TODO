- Fix the shared library filename format in dl.c (extension at least)
- Add version check macros/functions. We need two modes: version
  checks for xmlsec-cryto (exact match for major and minor versions
  required, subminor version might be greater) and for application
  (exact match for major version required, minor and subminor might be 
  greater).
- Unify password callback (one of parameters: filename)
- Split RPMs
