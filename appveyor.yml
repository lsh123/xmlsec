# Continuous Integration script for xmlsec
# Author: Peter Budai <peterbudai@hotmail.com>

# In order to enable appveyor CI in your GitHub repository, please follow the steps
# described in Appyors's Getting Started:  https://www.appveyor.com/docs/
#
# After you add your project to Appveyor, it will recognize this script, and will
# launch the first build process. Every build runs on a fresh virtual machine which is
# not shared with other builds and the state of which is not preserved between consequent
# builds. After the build is finished its virtual machine is decommissioned.
#
# You can check the whole build process in the logs, and any later commit will start
# a new build using a fresh virtual machine.
