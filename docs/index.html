             XML Security Library is a C library based on 
	     <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">LibXML2</a>.
      The library  supports major XML security standards:

<li>August 21 2003<br>
	The new <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.1.1</a> release
	adds &lt;X509Data/&gt; node templates support to xmlsec-nss (Tej);
	includes new functions for reading keys and certificates from memory 
	for xmlsec-core and xmlsec-openssl (Joachim); fixes several problems
	in xmlsec configuration files (Roumen) and a bug in URI attribute 
	XInclude processing.
</li>

<br><li>August 5 2003<br>
	A great patch from Tej that dramaticaly improves xmlsec-nss functionality
	deserves a minor version number update :). In addition to that, the new 
	<a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.1.0</a> 
	release includes &lt;X509Data/&gt; node templates support
	for xmlsec-openssl (Roumen); separate pkg-config files for xmlsec-crypto
	libraries and minor documentation updates (including coding style
	and some useful commands for xmlsec developers in a new "HACKING" 
	file).
</li>

<br><li>July 15 2003<br>
	There were several minor patches during last month and it's time to do 
	a new <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.0.4</a> 
	release to pick up them: x509 certificates names comparison function
	now supports multiple entries woth the same object name (Roumen); 
	multiple build fixes; documentation mistypes fixes.
	Also I gave an XML Security presentation at 
	<a href="http://oreillynet.com/oscon2003/">OSCON 2003</a> last week. 
	You can download slides <a href="http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/extra/xmlsec_oscon_2003.ppt">here</a>.
</li>

<br><li>June 17 2003<br>
	The <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.0.3</a> 
	release adds PKCS#8 support for xmlsec-openssl (Tej) and fixes several 
	configuration and portability problems.
</li>

<br><li>June 03 2003<br>
	The <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.0.2</a> 
	release includes several fixes in xmlsec-nss configuration and
	linking options (Tej), PKCS21 files reading improvements,
	minor documentation and help file fixes. Also this release
	includes some code for XKMS support. This is absolutely not usable
	right now and not configured in by default. Please, don't
	use or even compile it in.
</li>

<br><li>April 28 2003<br>
	The <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.0.1</a> 
	release is a maintanance release. It fixes several compilation 
	problems found in 1.0.0 release on the following platforms: 
	OpenBSD/sparc64, Win32 Wacom C, Sun Workshop CC 6.0. 
	Also from now on Win32 MSVC port enables the threading support 
	by default (this is a part of the Igor's change to LibXML2/LibXSLT/XMLSec
	libraries). If you don't use one of these platforms then you'll see 
	no difference.
</li>
<br><li>April 17 2003<br>
	The <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 1.0.0</a> 
	release is the major upgrade from 0.0.X version.
	The new version includes multiple crypto engines support
	(with "out of the box" support for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS);
	simplified and cleaned internal structure and API; 
	several performance and memory usage improvements;
	new or updated documentation (tutorial, API reference manual and 
	examples).
</li>
<br><li>April 10 2003<br>
	The final release candidate <a href="download.html">XML Security 
	Library 1.0.0rc1</a> is available for download. This release includes 
	minor API polishing, 
	complete <a href="api/xmlsec-ref.html">API Reference Manual</a>, 
	new chapters in the <a href="api/xmlsec-notes.html">tutorial</a> and 
	several new <a href="api/xmlsec-examples.html">examples</a>.
	Another big change is using major version number in library files
	to prevent collisions between different library versions.<br>
	If no major problems will be found then the 1.0.0 release should
	happen in a week from now.
	</li>
<br><li>April 8 2003<br>
	The new <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.0.15</a> 
	release is a preparation for the upcomming 1.0.0 release and
	provides an ability to have both versions installed together 
	on the same box. 
	Also this release includes updated expired certificates for 
	the regression test suite and a fix for minor bug in reading binary 
	keys on Windows.

<br><li>March 26 2003<br><a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.1.1</a>
	release is the first release candidate for the new stable 
	version of XML Security Library. A lot of internal changes 
	including enchanced processing controls, performance improvements
	for XML transforms, <a href="api/index.html">new documentation</a>,
	updated <a href="api/xmlsec-examples.html">examples</a>
	and many many other small things.<br>
	Please try this release and report bugs. Again, it's the first
	release candidate and it's very important for me to get your
	feedback about it. Also if you are missing some features
	in the library it's the best time to ask!
	</li>
<br><li>March 19 2003<br><a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.0.14</a> release
	includes several minor bugfixes in references URI
	processing, binary transforms processing and xmlsec 
	command line utility.
	</li>
<br><li>March 5 2003<br>
	The <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.1.0</a> release
	creates a framework for integrating XML Security Library
	with almost any crypto engine and even combining multiple crypto
	engines in one application. As an example, basic support for GnuTLS and NSS 
	libraries is provided (digests, hmac and block ciphers).<br>
	This is a pre-alpha release <b>not recommended</b> for production
	(please use the <a href="download.html">stable 0.0.X</a> releases 
	instead). The new 0.1.X API and ABI will defenetly change.
	However, if you plan to use XML Security Library with a new crypto
	engine and plan to write some code then you can start now. 
	The "backend" API is pretty stable and I do not expect major
	changes. 
	</li>
	<br><li>February 21 2003<br><a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.0.13</a> release
	fixes incorrect processing of signatures with more than 3 binary 
	transforms in a row, improved pkcs12 files support and minor
	documentation update.
	</li>
<br><li>January 26 2003<br>
	Two major fixes in <a href="http://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2003/000507.html">HMAC</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2003/000516.html">DES/AES</a> 
	algorithms are the reason for the new <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.0.12</a> release.
	Also there are few other minor features and bug fixes (see Changelog in the 
	distribution for more details).
	</li>
<br><li>December 3 2002<br>
	New <a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.0.11</a> release
	fixes a <a href="http://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2002/000368.html">major 
	problem</a> in Reference URI attribute processing. This release
	also includes several Win32 build process fixes from Igor.	
	</li>
<br><li>October 20 2002<br>
	Almost two months from previous release and a lot of minor 
	enchancements are good reasons for the new
	<a href="download.html">XML Security Library 0.0.10</a> release:<br>
	- added a way to specify "current time" to verify certificates
	expiration against it;<br>
	- implemented XML results output format for the xmlsec command
	line utility;<br>
	- fixed XMLDSig examples and added a new one (thanks to Devin 
	Heitmueller);<br>
	- resolved static link issue and a bunch of other improvements 
	for Win32 platform builds (Igor Zlatkovic);<br>
	- added dynamic linking option for xmlsec command line utility
	to help Debian port (John Belmonte);<br>
	- minor bug fixes.
