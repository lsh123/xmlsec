What version of Windows?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft CNG API is a set of BCrypt* and NCrypt* functions. Taking
BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider() as a representative example, the minimum
supported client is Windows Vista and the minimum supported server is Windows
Server 2008.

Keys manager with MS Certificate store support.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly to the nss and mscrypto backends, the xmlsec-mscng keys manager is
based on the simple keys store from xmlsec core. If keys are not found in the
simple keys store, then the MS Certificate store (the "MY" store by default,
visible as Personal -> Certificates in certmgr.msc) is used to look up keys.
The certificate store from the OS is a read-only store.
