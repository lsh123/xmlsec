WHAT VERSION OF OPENSSL?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later is required

KEYS MANAGER
------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSSL does not have a keys or certificates storage implementation. The
default xmlsec-openssl key manager uses a simple keys store from xmlsec
core library based on plain keys list. Trusted/untrusted certificates
are stored in STACK_OF(X509) structures.
